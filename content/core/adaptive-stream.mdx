title: Adaptive Stream
description: Automatically adjust video quality based on view size and visibility to optimize performance and save bandwidth.

## Overview

**Adaptive Stream** is a smart optimization that automatically selects the best video quality (resolution) for each subscriber, based on how and where the video is displayed â€” such as its **size on screen** and **whether itâ€™s visible**.

This helps deliver a good user experience while saving bandwidth, CPU, and battery â€” especially useful for mobile devices, small video tiles, or when the video is minimized.

## How It Works

When a user subscribes to a video track, **Adaptive Stream** looks at:

- The **size** of the video element (e.g. small on mobile vs. large on desktop)
- Whether the video is currently **visible** (e.g. hidden tab, minimized, or not in view)

Then, it automatically chooses the **most appropriate video quality** from the simulcast layers:

- ðŸ“± On **mobile**, a video might be shown in a smaller tile â†’ only **quarter resolution** is needed
- ðŸ’» On **desktop**, the same video could be larger â†’ **half** or **full resolution** may be selected
- ðŸ’¤ If the video is **not visible** (e.g. background tab) â†’ video may be paused or lowest resolution used

### Example

Letâ€™s say a publisher is sending these simulcast layers:

- **f** = Full resolution (e.g. 720p)
- **h** = Half resolution (e.g. 360p)
- **q** = Quarter resolution (e.g. 180p)

Depending on the subscriberâ€™s video view:

- **Small view** on mobile â†’ subscribe to **q**
- **Medium view** in a sidebar â†’ subscribe to **h**
- **Large view** (e.g. active speaker in fullscreen) â†’ subscribe to **f**

This adjustment is **automatic** and happens in real time as users resize windows or switch layouts.

## Benefits

âœ… **Optimized Bandwidth Usage**  
Only the needed video quality is delivered â€” saving data for both client and server.

âœ… **Improved Device Performance**  
Lower resolutions mean less work for the device's CPU and GPU, especially on low-end or mobile hardware.

âœ… **Better User Experience**  
Users get smooth video that matches the context â€” no need to waste resources on high-res video thatâ€™s shown in a tiny window.

âœ… **Responsive and Dynamic**  
Automatically reacts to layout changes like resizing windows, switching speakers, or entering picture-in-picture mode.
