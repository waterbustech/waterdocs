title: Architecture

Waterbus is a modular, distributed media infrastructure built for real-time performance, cost-efficiency, and scalability. It separates concerns into clear layers, while grouping key components together in real-world deployments.

## Layered Architecture

At a logical level, Waterbus consists of four main layers:

### 1. Signaling Layer

- Handles WebSocket/Socket.IO signaling from clients.
- Manages join/leave, publish/subscribe, renegotiation events.
- Maintains session states and initiates routing.

### 2. Dispatcher Layer

- Performs room assignment and SFU selection.
- Uses **etcd** for service discovery and live node tracking.
- Balances load and routes clients to the optimal SFU node.

### 3. SFU Layer

- Core of media routing: RTP forwarding, congestion control, simulcast/SVC adaptation.
- Receives peer connections and routes media with minimal delay.
- Supports REMB, TWCC, and track replacement mechanisms.

### 4. Egress Layer

- Transforms real-time media into broadcast formats:
  - **HLS / LL-HLS** for traditional live streaming.
  - **MoQ** for scalable low-latency broadcasting.
- Uses modular writers (`HlsWriter`, `MoQWriter`, etc.).

## Deployment Topology

While logically separated, Waterbus components are grouped in practice to optimize for latency and performance:

### Signaling + Dispatcher Node

- Co-located to reduce signaling latency.
- Exposes public WebSocket and HTTP APIs.
- Manages room creation and SFU assignment.

### SFU + Egress Node

- Media engine colocated with stream output.
- Avoids cross-node media copy for lower CPU/network usage.
- Stateless design for easy horizontal scaling.

## Coordination & Communication

### Service Coordination

- **etcd**: Backbone of dynamic service discovery and room lifecycle management.
- **Redis (optional)**: Pub/sub mechanism for signaling across multiple instances.

### Internal Protocols

- **gRPC**: Control plane API across Waterbus modules.
