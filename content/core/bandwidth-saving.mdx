title: Bandwidth Saving
description: How does Waterbus saving the server and client bandwidth usage?
---

Waterbus is optimized to minimize bandwidth usage for both clients and servers, ensuring scalable and efficient real-time communications. It employs several intelligent techniques to reduce unnecessary data transmission without compromising media quality or user experience.

## üéôÔ∏è Audio DTX (Discontinuous Transmission)

Waterbus enables **DTX** for audio tracks to avoid sending packets during silence. This significantly reduces bandwidth usage in real-world conversations where participants frequently pause between speech.

- **Without DTX**: Audio streams are sent continuously at ~20‚Äì40 kbps even during silence.
- **With DTX**: During silence, bandwidth drops to ~400‚Äì800 bps.
- **Result**: Up to **90‚Äì98% bandwidth savings** during silent periods.

This is especially impactful in large meetings where only a few participants are speaking at any given time.

## üìâ Dynacast (Layer Suspension)

Dynacast dynamically pauses **simulcast or SVC video layers** that are not being consumed by any subscribers. If no participant is viewing a specific resolution or quality layer, Waterbus stops forwarding and even stops requesting that stream from the publisher.

- Saves **uplink bandwidth** on the publisher side.
- Reduces **downlink bandwidth** and **processing load** on receivers.
- Frees up **server forwarding resources** in the SFU.

This is ideal for meetings with many passive listeners or minimized video tiles.

## üß† Adaptive Stream

Waterbus supports **adaptive streaming**, which automatically adjusts video resolution and bitrate based on:

- **View size** (e.g., thumbnail vs full screen)
- **Visibility** (e.g., hidden or background tabs)

Only the necessary quality level is sent, ensuring:

- Lower bandwidth consumption
- Improved performance on low-powered or mobile devices
- Smoother user experience in variable network conditions

## üîÑ Hybrid Topology (P2P + SFU)

Waterbus uses a **hybrid P2P-SFU architecture** to optimize for both performance and scalability:

- **1:1 Calls**: Use **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)** connection to minimize latency and eliminate server load.
- **Group Calls**: Automatically switch to **SFU mode** when more than two participants join, allowing scalable and efficient media routing.

This ensures that bandwidth is used efficiently in small sessions while retaining the ability to scale to large rooms seamlessly.

By combining DTX, Dynacast, Adaptive Streaming, and Hybrid Topology, Waterbus delivers a high-performance media experience while conserving bandwidth and reducing server costs.
