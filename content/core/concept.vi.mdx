Waterbus is built around three key entities that structure how users join, interact, and exchange media in a session: **Room**, **Participant**, and **Member**. Understanding these concepts is essential for integrating signaling, permissions, and media routing effectively.

---

## Room

A **Room** is a logical space where real-time media interaction happens. It acts as a container for participants and members.

### Characteristics

- Identified by a unique `room_id`.
- Created implicitly when the first participant joins.
- Automatically removed when the last participant leaves.
- Supports different room types (e.g., **Video Conferencing**, **Live Streaming**).
- Maintains a list of **members** (invited or public).

---

## Participant

A **Participant** represents a connected client who has joined a room. Each active device in the session corresponds to a participant.

### Characteristics

- Created when a client successfully joins a room.
- Destroyed when the client leaves the room or disconnects.
- Each participant has:
  - A unique `participant_id`.
  - Media state (published tracks, subscriptions).
- Authenticated via access token or room secret (if required).

### Responsibilities

- Negotiates WebRTC connection with the SFU.
- Publishes media (audio/video/screenshare).
- Subscribes to other members‚Äô media.
- Emits events for signaling (e.g., `join`, `leave`, `publish`, `subscribe`).

---

## Member

A **Member** is a registered or invited identity within a room. It does **not** represent a connected device, but a logical presence that may be associated with future participants.

### Characteristics

- Exists even when not connected.
- Used for:
  - Pre-registration or invitation to a room.
  - Role assignment (e.g., who is allowed to speak).
  - Joining a room **without a password**, if the room is public.
  - An assigned **role** (see [Roles](#Ô∏è-roles)).
- Members do not publish or subscribe directly ‚Äî participants do that once they join as a member.

## Roles

Waterbus defines roles to control permissions and behavior inside a room:

| Role        | Description                                                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Owner`     | Room creator; full permissions (kick, promote, mute, close room, etc.) |
| `Moderator` | Can moderate other participants (mute, assign roles, etc.)             |
| `Speaker`   | Can publish audio/video into the room.                                 |
| `Viewer`    | Read-only; can subscribe but cannot publish or speak.                  |

### Role Scopes by Room Type

- **Video Conferencing**:

  - Uses only `Owner` and `Speaker`.
  - All participants can talk and share media.

- **Live Streaming**:
  - May include `Moderator`, `Viewer`, and a limited set of `Speakers`.

## Summary

| Concept       | Represents                 | Created When            | Key Role                           |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `Room`        | A media session container  | First participant joins | Holds participants and members     |
| `Participant` | A connected client session | On join                 | Publishes/subscribes to media      |
| `Member`      | An identity in the room    | On invitation or public | Used to authorize and assign roles |

By separating **members** (who is allowed) from **participants** (who is connected), Waterbus enables flexible access control, public or private room joining, and fine-grained role management ‚Äî ideal for both small group calls and large-scale webinars.
