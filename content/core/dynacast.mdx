title: Dynacast
description: Dynamically pause video layers that no one is subscribed to — reducing bandwidth usage and saving device power.

## Overview

**Dynacast** is an optimization technique used in video streaming systems (especially SFUs) to improve performance and efficiency. It ensures that only the necessary video layers are encoded and sent when they're actually needed.

## How It Works

When using **simulcast**, a publisher (such as a webcam or screen share) sends multiple versions of the same video stream at different qualities — for example:

- **f** = Full (high) resolution
- **h** = Half (medium) resolution
- **q** = Quarter (low) resolution

Each subscriber can choose which quality they want to receive based on their device performance, network conditions, or UI layout.

### Dynacast Behavior

With **Dynacast enabled**:

- If no one is subscribed to a specific layer (e.g. the **f** layer), the publisher **automatically stops encoding and sending** that layer.
- Only the layers being used by subscribers (**h** and **q**, for example) will be encoded and transmitted.
- If later a new subscriber wants the **f** layer, the publisher resumes sending it.

### Example

Let’s say:

- The publisher is sending three layers: `f`, `h`, and `q`
- There are 2 subscribers:
  - One subscribes to `h`
  - One subscribes to `q`

In this case:

- The **`f`** (full quality) stream is **not needed**, so it will be **paused**
- Only **`h`** and **`q`** continue to be sent

> ✅ This means **less CPU usage, less bandwidth**, and **longer battery life** on the publisher's device.

## Benefits

✅ **Saves Bandwidth**  
Only streams that are actually being watched are transmitted — reducing network load for both client and server.

✅ **Improves Performance**  
By avoiding unnecessary video encoding, CPU and GPU resources are freed up — leading to smoother performance.

✅ **Extends Battery Life**  
Especially important for mobile devices and laptops: fewer video encodes = lower power consumption.

✅ **Scales Efficiently**  
Helps large calls or conferences scale better, since the system isn’t overloaded with unused video layers.
