## Introduction

**Waterbus** is a modern, high-performance **SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit)** and real-time media infrastructure designed for the next generation of interactive applications. Built in Rust, Waterbus provides scalable, low-latency media routing with support for **WebRTC**, **SVC**, **simulcast**, and **live streaming** over **HLS/LL-HLS**. It is designed with modularity and observability in mind, and includes SDKs, CLI tools, and server components to help developers integrate real-time media into their apps effortlessly.

**Waterbus** has different parts:

## What is Waterbus?

Waterbus is:

- A **Rust-powered WebRTC SFU** designed for real-time audio/video routing.
- A platform that supports **live streaming egress** to HLS and Low-Latency HLS.
- A system built for **scalability** with **service discovery**, **load balancing**, and **room lifecycle management**.
- A foundation for distributed media infrastructure, optimized for cloud-native environments.

Waterbus powers use cases where low-latency, high-quality media delivery matters ‚Äî whether for video conferencing, collaborative apps, or live broadcasting.

## Use Cases

- **Video Conferencing**: Scalable meetings with SFU-based forwarding and adaptive quality switching.
- **Live Streaming**: One-to-many streaming with LL-HLS support for real-time audience engagement.
- **Interactive Classrooms**: Low-latency communication for online learning and remote collaboration.
- **Gaming Voice Chat**: Real-time voice infrastructure that scales with player concurrency.
- **Media Egress & Recording**: Convert WebRTC sessions into HLS for recording or rebroadcasting.

## Architecture Overview

The Waterbus architecture is composed of multiple modular services:

Each SFU Node handles:

- Peer connection setup
- RTP/RTCP forwarding
- Track replacement & bandwidth adaptation
- Forwarding to egress modules

In production setups, Waterbus runs as multiple services communicating over QUIC/gRPC, with etcd ensuring coordination and dynamic room mapping.
