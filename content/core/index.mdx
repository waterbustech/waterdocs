## Introduction

**Waterbus** is a modern, high-performance **media server** and **real-time infrastructure** designed for the next generation of interactive applications. Built in Rust, it supports **WebRTC**, **Simulcast**, **SVC**, and egress to **HLS**, **LL-HLS**, and **MoQ** — optimized for low latency, scalability, and cost-efficiency.

Waterbus automatically handles peer-to-peer connections for up to 2 participants. When a third participant joins, the session seamlessly migrates to the **SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit)** — ensuring optimal performance without user disruption.

## Why Waterbus Media Server?

Waterbus is purpose-built for teams and platforms that need **low-latency**, **high-quality**, and **cost-efficient** media delivery:

- ⚡ **P2P + SFU Hybrid** — Direct peer-to-peer for 1:1 calls, automatic SFU scaling for group sessions.
- 🦀 **Rust Performance** — Low memory footprint, high concurrency, and zero-cost abstractions.
- 🌐 **Cloud-Native** — Distributed architecture with service discovery, load balancing, and Helm chart support.
- 🧩 **Modular Design** — Flexible egress writers (HLS, MoQ), CLI tools, and SDKs.

Whether it's a video meeting, livestream, or classroom — Waterbus adapts intelligently and efficiently.

## Use Cases

### 🧑‍💼 Low-Latency Meetings

- Perfect for video conferencing, daily standups, or collaborative sessions.  
- Waterbus starts with **peer-to-peer (P2P)** when there are two participants for ultra-low latency.  
- As soon as a third participant joins, the session **automatically upgrades to SFU mode**, optimizing media forwarding and reducing bandwidth usage on clients.  
- With **REMB** and **TWCC** support, Waterbus adapts stream quality in real-time to match network conditions — ensuring smooth and stable experiences across devices.

### 🎙️ AMA-Style Broadcasts

- Great for interactive Q&A sessions, online panels, or webinars where a few participants speak and many listen.  
- Using **MoQ (Media over QUIC)**, Waterbus allows scalable, low-latency media delivery with selective forwarding.  
- Speakers are forwarded efficiently to large audiences, while listeners benefit from fast startup time and minimal delay.  
- MoQ also helps reduce server load and egress costs by leveraging shared delivery paths.

### 📺 Traditional Live Streaming

- Use Waterbus to stream to a wide audience with **HLS** or **Low-Latency HLS (LL-HLS)**.  
- This is ideal for concerts, townhalls, sports events, or any broadcast-style content where compatibility and reach are critical.  
- Streams can be recorded, restreamed, or distributed via CDN — giving you flexibility in how you scale and deliver your content.  
- Waterbus provides modular output writers like `HlsWriter` that allow easy integration with cloud storage or CDN workflows.

## Architecture Overview

<img src="/images/arch.svg" alt="Architecture Diagram" />

Each SFU Node is responsible for:

- Establishing peer connections
- Forwarding RTP/RTCP
- Dynamic track replacement and quality adaptation
- Streaming to external outputs (HLS, MoQ)

<Callout title="Info">
In production deployments, Waterbus runs as distributed services over QUIC/gRPC with etcd for coordination.
