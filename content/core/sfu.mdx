<Callout title="What is an SFU?" icon={<SatelliteDish />}>
  A **Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU)** receives media streams from participants
  and forwards them to others, without decoding or re-encoding. This enables
  **low latency** and **scalable** real-time communication.
</Callout>

Waterbus's SFU is the core of its real-time media infrastructure. Built in **Rust**, it is optimized for performance and reliability, supporting modern WebRTC features like **Simulcast**, **Scalable Video Coding (SVC)**, and **bandwidth-aware adaptive forwarding** using **Transport-Wide Congestion Control (TWCC)** and **Receiver Estimated Maximum Bitrate (REMB)**.

## Responsibilities

The SFU node is responsible for:

- üì° **Receiving Peer Connections**  
  Accepts WebRTC connections, handles ICE, DTLS, and decrypts SRTP streams.

- üîÄ **Media Routing**  
  Forwards RTP packets to all subscribers of a given track with minimal latency.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Adaptive Quality Switching**  
  Dynamically selects the best quality (Simulcast or SVC layer) for each subscriber based on real-time network feedback using TWCC and REMB.

- üîÅ **Track Replacement**  
  Seamlessly switches between different video layers or qualities on the fly without interruption.

- üì§ **Egress Forwarding**  
  Sends selected streams to egress pipelines such as **HLS** or **MoQ** for cloud recording or live broadcast.

- üß† **Publisher Feedback for Layer Thinning**  
  Informs publishers to stop sending unused Simulcast or SVC layers when no subscriber needs them ‚Äî saving **bandwidth** and **device battery**.

## How It Works

Each participant establishes a WebRTC connection with the SFU. The flow is:

1. **Negotiation** of ICE, DTLS, and SRTP.
2. **Media Reception** of encoded RTP (e.g., VP8, H264 for video; Opus for audio).
3. **Media Forwarding** to one or more subscribers.
4. **Bandwidth Monitoring** via TWCC and REMB feedback loops.
5. **Dynamic Layer Switching** based on real-time network conditions.
6. **Publisher Coordination** to reduce unnecessary uplink usage.

## Simulcast and SVC Handling with TWCC

Waterbus supports:

- **Simulcast**: Multiple streams at different resolutions (e.g., 720p, 480p, 240p).
- **SVC (Scalable Video Coding)**: A single encoded stream with multiple enhancement layers (temporal, spatial).

Using **TWCC (Transport-Wide Congestion Control)**, the SFU can accurately measure network performance such as packet loss and RTT for each subscriber. This enables:

- Per-subscriber quality adaptation
- Automatic layer switching (e.g., drop from 720p to 480p under poor conditions)
- Smart subscription logic to avoid overloading weak connections

---

## Real-world Example: Publisher Sends f, h, q

Let‚Äôs say a publisher is sending three Simulcast layers:

- `f` = Full resolution (e.g., 1280x720)
- `h` = Half resolution (e.g., 640x360)
- `q` = Quarter resolution (e.g., 320x180)

Initially, all layers are sent to the SFU.

Now, imagine:

- Only one subscriber is watching the stream.
- That subscriber is on a poor network, and only receives the `q` layer.

### Optimization

- The SFU detects that no subscriber is using the `h` or `f` layers.
- The SFU sends a **Layer Feedback Message** to the publisher:

  > ‚ÄúStop sending layer `h` ‚Äî no one is using it right now.‚Äù

- The publisher **pauses** the `h` stream.
- Result: **Lower CPU**, **less upload bandwidth** on the publisher's device, and **less processing load** on the SFU.

If later another subscriber joins with good network conditions, the SFU will request:

> ‚ÄúPlease resume layer `h` ‚Äî a new viewer needs it.‚Äù

This approach enables **real-time resource optimization**, ideal for mobile users and large-scale broadcasts.

## Architecture Overview

The SFU node integrates with other components like the **Dispatcher** (for room control) and **Egress Modules** (for output streaming):

- SFU nodes are **stateless** ‚Äî they don‚Äôt store media history.
- Room state and session assignments are managed by the **Dispatcher** using **etcd**.
- This design allows **horizontal scaling**, fault tolerance, and fast recovery.
