title: Getting Started
---

## Install Rust

* Install Rust via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

## Add dependency

* Add the dependency from command-line

```bash
$ flutter pub add waterbus_sdk
```

* The command above will add this to the pubspec.yaml file in your project (you can do this manually):

```yaml
dependencies:
  waterbus_sdk: ^1.5.1
```

## Configuration

### Android

Ensure the following permission is present in your Android Manifest file, located in `<project root>/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS" />
```

If you need to use a Bluetooth device, please add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
```

The Flutter project template adds it, so it may already be there.

Also you will need to set your build settings to Java 8, because official WebRTC jar now uses static methods in `EglBase` interface. Just add this to your app level `build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    //...
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

Setup for Beauty Filters:

- Add gpupixel in dependencies:

```groovy
implementation 'tech.waterbus:gpupixel:1.0.2'
```

- Create `FlutterViewEngine.kt`:

```kotlin
class FlutterViewEngine(val engine: FlutterEngine) : LifecycleObserver, ExclusiveAppComponent<Activity>{
    private var callbackHelper = PipCallbackHelper()
    private var flutterView: FlutterView? = null
    private var activity: ComponentActivity? = null
    private var platformPlugin: PlatformPlugin? = null

    init {
        callbackHelper.configureFlutterEngine(engine)
    }

    /**
     * This is the intersection of an available activity and of a visible [FlutterView]. This is
     * where Flutter would start rendering.
     */
    private fun hookActivityAndView() {
        // Assert state.
        activity!!.let { activity ->
            flutterView!!.let { flutterView ->
                platformPlugin = PlatformPlugin(activity, engine.platformChannel)

                engine.activityControlSurface.attachToActivity(this, activity.lifecycle)
                flutterView.attachToFlutterEngine(engine)
                activity.lifecycle.addObserver(this)

                activity.addOnPictureInPictureModeChangedListener {
                    callbackHelper.onPictureInPictureModeChanged(it.isInPictureInPictureMode)
                }
            }
        }

        platformPlugin!!.destroy()
        platformPlugin = null

        // Set Flutter's application state to detached.

- Create `activity_main.xml`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    tools:context=".MainActivity">

    <io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterView
        android:id="@+id/flutterView"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:focusable="true"
        android:focusableInTouchMode="true"/>

    <!-- GPUPixelView -->
    <com.pixpark.gpupixel.GPUPixelView
        android:id="@+id/surfaceView"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="40dp"
        tools:layout_editor_absoluteX="-183dp"
        tools:layout_editor_absoluteY="0dp" />

</RelativeLayout>
```

- Update `MainActivity.kt`:

```kotlin
package com.waterbus.wanted

import android.content.Intent
import android.os.Bundle
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
import com.example.waterbus.FlutterViewEngine
import com.pixpark.gpupixel.GPUPixel
import com.waterbus.wanted.databinding.ActivityMainBinding
import io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine
import io.flutter.embedding.engine.dart.DartExecutor

class MainActivity: AppCompatActivity()  {
    private lateinit var binding: ActivityMainBinding
    private lateinit var flutterViewEngine: FlutterViewEngine

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        binding = ActivityMainBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
        setContentView(binding.root)

        // TODO: create a multi-engine version after
        // https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/72009 is built.
        val engine = FlutterEngine(applicationContext)
        engine.dartExecutor.executeDartEntrypoint(
            DartExecutor.DartEntrypoint.createDefault()
        );

        flutterViewEngine = FlutterViewEngine(engine)
        // The activity and FlutterView have different lifecycles.
        // Attach the activity right away but only start rendering when the
        // view is also scrolled into the screen.
        flutterViewEngine.attachToActivity(this)

        val flutterView = binding.flutterView

        // Attach FlutterEngine to FlutterView
        flutterView.attachToFlutterEngine(engine)
        flutterViewEngine.attachFlutterView(flutterView)

        GPUPixel.setContext(applicationContext)
    }

    override fun onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy()
        flutterViewEngine.detachActivity()
    }

    override fun onRequestPermissionsResult(
        requestCode: Int,
        permissions: Array<out String>,
        grantResults: IntArray
    ) {
        flutterViewEngine.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults)
        super.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults)
    }

    override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {
        flutterViewEngine.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)
        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)
    }

    override fun onUserLeaveHint() {
        flutterViewEngine.onUserLeaveHint()
        super.onUserLeaveHint()
    }
}
```

### iOS

Add the following entry to your _Info.plist_ file, located in `<project root>/ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) Camera Usage!</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) Microphone Usage!</string>
```

This entry allows your app to access camera and microphone.

### Note for iOS.
The WebRTC.xframework compiled after the m104 release no longer supports iOS arm devices, so need to add the `config.build_settings['ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH'] = 'YES'` to your ios/Podfile in your project

ios/Podfile

```ruby
post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    flutter_additional_ios_build_settings(target)
     target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      # Workaround for https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/64502
      config.build_settings['ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH'] = 'YES' # <= this line
     end
  end
end
```
